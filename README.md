# Maze Generator
This program generates a maze using the DFS algorithm and tkinter to create a simple interface. Users can choose the size of the maze and whether to generate a gif of the maze being built or a PNG of the completed maze.

## Usage
To use the DFS Maze Generator, simply run the program and follow the instructions on the interface. Users can select the size of the maze using the slider, and choose whether to generate a gif or a PNG using the checkboxes.

If the user chooses to generate a gif, they will be prompted to choose the name of the file to save the gif to. Once the gif is generated, it can be viewed to see how the maze was built step by step.

If the user chooses to generate a PNG, they will be prompted to choose the name of the file to save the maze to. The completed maze will be saved as a PNG file.
